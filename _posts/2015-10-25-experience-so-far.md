&emsp;I have been working on this website for a little over a week now.  I have found the experience mixed in terms of difficulty.  I was lucky enough to find a good template for this site, written by Jonathan McGlone.  The difficult part was trying to make it my own.

### Theme: Aesthetics and Readability

&emsp;The theme of the website (colors, fonts, and layout) were slowly modified over time to get to where it is now.  It was, and still is, an evolving theme.  The original was black on white with a little color, but I wanted something different.  

&emsp;I had originally created a blue textured background behind the main section where the text is laid-out.  The main section, or container of text, had a light sepia-like texture background, so that text was easy to read.  It was definitely unique, but was not aesthetically pleasing to me.  

&emsp;After slowly tweaking the style over the course of several days, I settled upon a gray and white background, flat, with black text and some dark blue and dark red for links and borders respectively.  It looks crisper than my previous attempt, and is just as unique.

&emsp;I also took into consideration readability and aesthetic of fonts.  I remember hearing about the debate between fans of serif fonts and fans of sans-serif fonts about the readability of each.  I decided it was better to let the viewer choose.  The default I chose was Libre Baskerville, a serif font, which is similar to font seen in many books.  For the sans-serif font, I chose Arimo, for its similarity to Helvetica.

### Customization: CSS and Javascript

&emsp;All of this detailed editing and attention to detail is only possible with pages that can be customized at the HTML/CSS/Javascript level.  GitHub Pages allows for this level of editing at the cost of more complexity.  

&emsp;Though to help with the complexity, they offer a tool called Jekyll, which allows the building of the site from many different parts.  The individual parts can be worked on separately which eases the difficulty somewhat.

As it stands, I'm still learning HTML5 as I go along, which includes CSS and Javascript as well.  I'm also learning how to use Markdown (which is what I'm using right now to write this post), and I'm also becoming familiar with the Jekyll project structure and all of the things that can be done with it.

### Overall

&emsp;I'm fairly happy with what I've created, and I'm also content with the platform I chose to develop it on.  It has been more difficult to think of things to write about than to actually build the web page.  Hopefully I will start to bring more content after a while, once I get used to it.
