<div markdown="1" style="text-align: justify">&emsp;I have been working on this website for a little over a week now.  I have found the experience mixed in terms of difficulty.  I was, however, lucky to find a good template from which to base this site---thanks to Jonathan McGlone.  The difficult part was in trying to make it my own.

### Theme: Aesthetics and Readability

&emsp;The theme of this website (the colors, fonts, and layout) changed over time to get to where it is now.  It was, and still is, an ever evolving theme.  The original was black text on white with a little color mixed in, but I wanted something different.  

&emsp;I had originally created a blue textured background behind the main section, or container, where the text is laid-out.  The container of text had a white paper-like textured background, so that the text was easy to read.  From the background color, I derived a complementary color for borders and a similar color for links. It was definitely unique, but it was not aesthetically pleasing to me.  

&emsp;After slowly tweaking the style over the course of several days, I settled upon a flat gray background and flat white container with black text and some dark blue and dark red for links and borders respectively.  It looks crisper than my previous attempt, and much more aesthetically pleasing.

&emsp;I also took into consideration the readability and aesthetic of fonts.  I remember hearing about the debate between fans of serif fonts and fans of sans-serif fonts about which one is better.  I decided it was better to let the viewer decide instead of joining the fray.  The default I chose was Libre Baskerville, a serif font, which is similar to fonts I've seen in many physical books.  For the sans-serif font, I chose Arimo for its similarity to Helvetica.  I also considered having more choice in fonts, but that would have several downsides, including a longer load-time.

### Customization: CSS and Javascript

&emsp;All of this editing and attention to detail is only possible with pages that can be customized at the HTML/CSS/Javascript level.  GitHub Pages allows for this level of editing at the cost of more complexity---plus, its free. To help with the complexity, they offer a tool called Jekyll, which builds the site from many different parts.  The individual parts can be worked on, which in turn simplifies development and design.

As it stands, I'm still learning HTML5 as I go along, which includes CSS and Javascript.  I'm also learning how to write in Markdown (which is what I'm using right now to write this post), and to become more familiar with the Jekyll project structure and all of the things that can be done with it.

### Overall

&emsp;I'm happy with what I've created thus far, and I'm also content with the platform I chose to develop it on.  It has been more difficult for me to think of things to write about than to actually build the website.  Hopefully I will start to bring more content after a while, once I get used writing more.
