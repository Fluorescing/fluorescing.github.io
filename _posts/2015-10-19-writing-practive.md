<div markdown="1" style="text-align: justify">&emsp;I've decided to create a blog as a way of improving my own writing ability---and to get over my fear of posting things online.  In the past, I have created and removed websites and blogs I've created, mostly because of inactivity or my extreme shyness.  This time, I will make an attempt to keep on posting regularly, on a variety of topics.

&emsp;I'm not entirely sure what I will be writing about.  For my first blog post, I chose an essay I wrote recently, about the Turing Machine, as it was easily available.  But I could have just as well posted a tutorial on programming or a blurb about the fact I'm writing a blog---which is what I'm doing now.

&emsp;As for the topics, I'd like to have a variety.  I do have many interests, so I may as well write about them.  Maybe I write about my experiences going to an art exhibit, or an essay on a random historical event.  Only time will tell where this blog will lead.
