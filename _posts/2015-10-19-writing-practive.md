&emsp;I've decided to create a blog online as a way of improving my own writing---and to get over my fear of posting things online.  I have created and removed websites and blogs in the past, but have since removed them because of inactivity or embarrassment.  I will make an attempt to keep posting at least semi-regularly on a variety of topics.

&emsp;I'm not entirely sure what I will be writing about.  I chose an essay I wrote about the Turing Machine as my first blog post as it was easily available.  But I could've just as well posted a tutorial on programming or a blurb about the fact I'm writing a blog---what I'm writing now.

&emsp;As for the subjects, I'd like to keep them varied.  I have many interests, I may as well write about them.  Maybe my experiences going to an art exhibit, or an essay on a random historical event I just so happened to look up.  Only time will tell where this blog will lead.
